## Abstract

In this study, we analyze the efficiency of acupuncture for treatment of lower back pain compared to a control group receiving sham acupuncture in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) [@do2017acupuncture]. Hello

## Methods

Participants were randomly assigned to receive either real acupuncture (treatment group) or sham acupuncture (control group). Pain levels were measured using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) before and after treatment.

## Results

# Dataset

# Dataset

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
  Name = c("patient 1", "patient 2", "patient 3", "patient 4", "patient 5", "patient 6"),
  Group = c("treatment", "control", "treatment", "treatment", "control", "control"),
  VAS_Pre = c(9, 8, 7, 6, 7, 5),
  VAS_Post = c(4, 7, 3, 2, 6, 4)
) %>%
  mutate(VAS_Change = VAS_Pre - VAS_Post)
```

# Table

```{r}
flextable(df) |>
  set_caption("VAS Scores Before and After Treatment") |>
  theme_booktabs() |>
  autofit()

```{r}
# Bar Plot
ggplot(df, aes(x = Name, y = VAS_Change, fill = Group)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.6) +
  labs(
    title = "VAS Change After Treatment",
    x = "Patient",
    y = "VAS Change (Pre - Post)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
