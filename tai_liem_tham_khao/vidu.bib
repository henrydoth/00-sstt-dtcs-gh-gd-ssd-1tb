	abstract = {Insomnia appears to be a fast-spreading problem in the modern days, which not only affects people's living quality but also impairs people's working efficiency  even causing disability. Pharmacological treatment is effective but frequently  with significant side effects. Acupuncture is traditionally used for the  treatment of insomnia in China and now is widely accepted in the Western  countries. Many research works on clinical applications of acupuncture in the  treatment of insomnia and the potential mechanisms underlying the acupuncture  treatment have been reported. This chapter will try to provide a systematic  review on the research findings. A number of clinical studies, mainly randomized  controlled clinical trials, have shown positive effects in acupuncture treatment  of insomnia. Some of the studies demonstrated that acupuncture treatment appeared  to be better than conventional pharmacological drugs in the improvement of  insomnia. These encouraging findings are limited by the qualities problems of the  methodology used in these clinical studies. The clinical efficacy of acupuncture  appeared to be supported by evidence obtained from basic neuroendocrinological  studies. A number of studies have demonstrated that acupuncture may modulate a  wide range of neuroendocrinological factors following stimulation of acupoints.  Evidence has suggested that the clinical efficacy of acupuncture in treatment of  insomnia is potentially mediated by a variety of neurotransmitters including  norepinephrine, melatonin, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and β-endorphin. However, due  to the complexity, these findings are far from conclusive. More research is  necessary. More rigors methodology and integrated approach to evaluate both  clinical and basic research evidence are required for future studies.},
