	abstract = {Neuropsychologists provide detailed assessments of cognitive and emotional functioning that often cannot be obtained through other diagnostic means. They  use standardized assessment tools and integrate the findings with other data to  determine whether cognitive decline has occurred, to differentiate neurologic  from psychiatric conditions, to identify neurocognitive etiologies, and to  determine the relationship between neurologic factors and difficulties in daily  functioning. Family physicians should consider referring patients when there are  questions about diagnostic decision making or planning of individualized  management strategies for patients with mild cognitive impairment, dementia,  traumatic brain injury, and other clinical conditions that affect cognitive  functioning. Neuropsychological testing can differentiate Alzheimer dementia from  nondementia with nearly 90\% accuracy. The addition of neuropsychological testing  to injury severity variables (e.g., posttraumatic amnesia) increases predicted  accuracy in functional outcomes. A neuropsychological evaluation can be helpful  in addressing concerns about functional capacities (e.g., ability to drive or  live independently) and in determining a patient's capacity to make decisions  about health care or finances. Most patients who underwent neuropsychological  evaluation and their significant others reported that they found the evaluation  helpful in understanding and coping with cognitive problems.},
